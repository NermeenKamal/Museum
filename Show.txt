The Museum of Egyptian Antiquities:
known commonly as the Egyptian Museum or the Cairo Museum, in Cairo, Egypt, 
is home to an extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities. It has 120,000 items, with a representative amount on display
and the remainder in storerooms. Built in 1901 by the Italian construction company, Garozzo-Zaffarani, to a design by the French architect
Marcel Dourgnon, the edifice is one of the largest museums in the region. As of March 2019, the museum was open to the public.
In 2022, the museum is due to be superseded by the newer and larger Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza.
